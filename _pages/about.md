* I am currently a research assistant at the [National High Performance Computing Center](<http://nhpcc.szu.edu.cn>), advised by Prof. [Xuan Yang](<http://nhpcc.szu.edu.cn/web/view66c9.html?path=154-184-&id=667>). My main work is to engaged in some research projects about segmentation and super resolution for biomedical image.
* My research interests lie in the general area of deep learning, including Image Classification, Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Super Resolution.
* I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Shenzhen University](<https://en.szu.edu.cn/>). My undergraduate research advisors is Prof. [Xuan Yang](<http://nhpcc.szu.edu.cn/web/view66c9.html?path=154-184-&id=667>).

* In my spare time, I like to read papers about Image Classification and try to propose new CNN architecture. I can optimize the underlying code of the deep learning framework if needed.
